         *  The [param arrays] argument is an array of arrays. Each of the [constant Mesh.ARRAY_MAX] elements contains an array with some of the mesh data for this surface as described by the corresponding member of [enum Mesh.ArrayType] or `null` if it is not used by the surface. For example, `arrays[0]` is the array of vertices. That first vertex sub-array is always required; the others are optional. Adding an index array puts this surface into "index mode" where the vertex and other arrays become the sources of data and the index array defines the vertex order. All sub-arrays must have the same length as the vertex array (or be an exact multiple of the vertex array's length, when multiple elements of a sub-array correspond to a single vertex) or be empty, except for [constant Mesh.ARRAY_INDEX] if it is used.  
         *  The [param blend_shapes] argument is an array of vertex data for each blend shape. Each element is an array of the same structure as [param arrays], but [constant Mesh.ARRAY_VERTEX], [constant Mesh.ARRAY_NORMAL], and [constant Mesh.ARRAY_TANGENT] are set if and only if they are set in [param arrays] and all other entries are `null`.  
         *  The [param lods] argument is a dictionary with [float] keys and [PackedInt32Array] values. Each entry in the dictionary represents a LOD level of the surface, where the value is the [constant Mesh.ARRAY_INDEX] array to use for the LOD level and the key is roughly proportional to the distance at which the LOD stats being used. I.e., increasing the key of a LOD also increases the distance that the objects has to be from the camera before the LOD is used.  
         *  The [param flags] argument is the bitwise or of, as required: One value of [enum Mesh.ArrayCustomFormat] left shifted by `ARRAY_FORMAT_CUSTOMn_SHIFT` for each custom channel in use, [constant Mesh.ARRAY_FLAG_USE_DYNAMIC_UPDATE], [constant Mesh.ARRAY_FLAG_USE_8_BONE_WEIGHTS], or [constant Mesh.ARRAY_FLAG_USES_EMPTY_VERTEX_ARRAY].
